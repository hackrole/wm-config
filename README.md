# wm-config

Configuration of my window managers of choice on OSX and Linux

## Linux: XMonad

I have XMonad set up on linux with six different workspaces for different purposes. I also
have [Xmobar](http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/) set up to display a small amount of system
data.

## OSX: Hammerspoon

I recently switched from Spectacle to [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) because of the configurability, and use it
with a tallscreen divided into thirds at work. I am still working on increasing the extent of
customisation.
